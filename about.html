        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2020 in the heart of Yangon, <span class="highlight">Than Lwin Cafe</span> started as a small, family-run tea shop with a dream: 
          to bring the warmth of traditional Burmese flavors to everyone. What began with just a few homemade dishes has grown into a cozy cafe loved by locals and tourists alike.
